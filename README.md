This repository contains three machine-certified proofs of linearizability that appear in "Machine-Verification of Linearizability":
* [HerlihyWingQueue.tla](https://github.com/uguryavuz/machine-certified-linearizability/blob/main/HerlihyWingQueue.tla) contains the TLAPS proof for the linearizability of the Herlihy-Wing queue implementation.
* [JayantiSingleScannerSnapshot.tla](https://github.com/uguryavuz/machine-certified-linearizability/blob/main/JayantiSingleScannerSnapshot.tla) contains the TLAPS proof for the linearizability of the Jayanti single-scanner snapshot implementation.
* [JayantiTarjanUnionFind.tla](https://github.com/uguryavuz/machine-certified-linearizability/blob/main/JayantiTarjanUnionFind.tla) contains the TLAPS proof for the strong linearizability of the Jayanti-Tarjan union-find object implementation.
